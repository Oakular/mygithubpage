<h2>
----- Installation and Video Tutorial
</h2>

<h3>First you will need to install Git on your system: <a
    href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">Install
    Link</a><br>
Second I recommend watching this video:
    <a
    href="https://youtu.be/HVsySz-h9r4?list=PL-osiE80TeTuRUfjRe54Eea17-YfnOOAx">Git
    Tutorial</a><br>
    (ensure that you understand the process of pushing and pulling using Git)
</h3>

<i>If you don't want to watch the video I have made a very brief overview
    below.<br>
    It will suffice to get you using Git but the video covers more functionality
    that is going to be necessary to work effectively as a team</i>

<h2>
----- First lets clear the confusion:
</h2>

<h3>
    ---- Difference between <i>Git</i> and <i>Github</i>:
</h3>

<ul>
    <li> Git is the Version Control Software </li>
    <li> Github is a website to <b>push</b> and <b>pull</b> source code to/from </li>

    <li> Github provides us with a central server to use Git with </li>
</ul>

<h3>
---- Git works on all 3 major OSes
</h3>
For UNIX systems (Linux, macOS) install Git via the package manager for your
system. The website link above suggests downloading git directly for Mac. I
suggest using <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> instead.
<ul>
    On Ubuntu: <code> sudo apt-get install git-all </code><br>
    On macOS (with Homebrew): <code> brew install git </code><br>
    <b>paste the commands into your terminal</b>
</ul>

On Windows download the executable file from the website above.

<h3>
---- I recommend using the terminal commands
</h3>
    <h4> Why? </h4>
    <ul>
        <li> Once you have learnt them, they are faster to use </li>
        <li> There is no official Git GUI and in industry not every company uses
        GitHub. Just knowing their GUI is not good practice </li>
    </ul>

    <br><br>
<h2>
----- MAJOR GIT COMMANDS -----
</h2>
    <ul>
<code> git init </code> : when you run this command in your current directory
it will add that directory (and any sub-directories) to be tracked by git
<code> git add <file> </code> : this command tells git to "track" a file. This means git will
become aware of any changes to the file and will stage them ready for "commit"

<br><br>
<code> git commit | -a | -m </code> : this command commits a change that you have made. it is
important to note that this does NOT upload the change to Github.<br> It just locks
in the change you have made so that the next time you push to Github this commit
will be uploaded with that push
    <br>
    <ul>
    - The <code>-a</code> flag tells git to add any changed files before making a commit (it
    skips the use of the add command shown above) <br>
    - The <code>-m</code> command opens a text editor to add a message alongside a commit. It
    is good practice to leave a message with every commit to detail it
    </ul>

<br><br>
<code> git push <i>git-server-name</i> <i>branch-name</i> </code> : this command
will push any commits you have made to Github.<br> This is
the command that uploads those changes to the central repository

<br><br>
<code> git pull <i>git-server-name</i> <i>branch-name</i> </code> : the pull command syncs your local repository with the one hosted on
Github. <br>
This command is used to make your version of the source code up to date
    </ul>

    <h2><i>If you understand these four commands you can use Git.<br>
        For the project though you will need most of the knowledge covered in
        the video above</i></h2>
